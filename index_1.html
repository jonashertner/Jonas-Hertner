        <div class="service-item">
          <p data-key="services.service1.description">Not every legal dispute is worth taking to court. Often, parties can find a reasonable settlement out of court. To reach a favourable outcome in or out of court, or through mediation, in any legal dispute, it is important to anticipate possible consequences of any step taken as early as possible when a dispute is on the horizon. With more than a decade of top-level litigation experience, Jonas will help you consider not only your own perspective, but also those of the opposing side and any arbiter who may ultimately decide the dispute, allowing you to take the most effective action at each turn on the way to securing your interest.</p>
